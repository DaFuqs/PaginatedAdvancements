# Make your advancement screen not suck

Paginated Advancements completely overhauls the advancement screen by adding a load of features:

- Makes the screen bigger, instead of a fixed size
- Adds Pagination (no "this modpack has too many tabs to display them all" anymore!)
- Pin the advancement tabs you are currently focusing on
- Remembering the last opened tab

Also adds some styling options, to make the screen exactly how you prefer it:
- Disable background fading
- Configurable Spacing between tabs. Allowing them to be condensed quite a bit, or giving them more room to breathe

## Additional Advancement Frames & Colors
With version 2.0 comes the ability to register new advancement frames, including custom colors, via data pack / mods that support it. [Find out how in the Wiki](https://github.com/DaFuqs/PaginatedAdvancements/wiki)
